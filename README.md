AcousticHD - Seu reposiÃ³rio de cifras e letras para as mÃºsicas que vocÃª toca ðŸ˜€

This is a fullstack project I've started intending to improve my skills in both back and front-end web development. 
It's functionality consists in basically store songs chords and lyrics uploaded by a user. You can add songs to bookmarks and search for your recently viewed songs.  


Built with: 
- NODE 14.19.0
- Express
- Sqlite and Sequelize ORM
- VueJS and Vuetify
- and more...


### Clone this repository and open with VScode (or your favourite IDE)

from root directory: 
### SERVER START: 
``` ~ cd ./server ```
``` ~ npm install```
``` ~ npm run dev``` to start without building
now server is running on PORT 8081 or whichever defined in .env

### FRONT-END START: 
``` ~ cd ./client ```
``` ~ npm install```
``` ~ npm run start``` to start development compiling and hot-reloads
now the front-end is running on port 8080 by default.
